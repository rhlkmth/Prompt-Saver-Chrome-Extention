Unable to find a Chrome extension for saving AI art prompts, I set out to create a simple one of my own using chatGPT and Claude.ai


This extension allows you to easily bookmark prompts used on sites like Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, and MidJourney.

As you generate images, select text and right click save. Revisit your collected prompts anytime by clicking the extension. It stores everything cleanly so you can rerun favorites or tweak prompts to iterate on ideas.

This lightweight tool helps creatives using AI art generators to keep track of their prompt experiments in one place for continued inspiration and iteration. Built with JavaScript and using Chrome storage for portability.
